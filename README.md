# Core-Periphery
This is The repository for the code in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06388) about core-periphery structure in complex networks.
There are 3 files:
    Sim_ROC.R —— this is the main file. Running through this file will generate the figures in the simulation section.
    Helper_functions.R —— Contains the helper functions.
    Methods.R —— This file contains two functions, corresponding to our two proposed algorithms in the paper.
The code is for the simulation examples in the main paper. For additional examples in the appendix, simply modify the parameters accordingly.

The code was originally generately by the first author of the paper, Ruizhong Miao. Please contact us for questions (rm9dd@virginia.edu, tianxili@virginia.edu).
